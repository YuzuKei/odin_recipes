            <li>Kosher Salt</li>
            <li>Cinnamon</li>
            <li>Unsalted Butter</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Granulated Sugar</li>

        </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Line a rimmed baking pan with parchment paper ensuring all edges are covered.  Pan size should be approximately 15x10 inches or 40x25 cm.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, begin whipping the egg whites with a hand or stand mixer on medium-high speed.  After 1 minute, begin adding ½ cup/100 g of sugar in small amounts until stiff peaks form, about 4 additional minutes.</li>
            <li>In another large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks with the remaining sugar, milk, rum, oil and salt.</li>
            <li>Sift the flour and the baking powder directly into the chestnut mixture and whisk until they are fully incorporated.</li>
            <li>Gently fold a large dollop of the egg whites into the chestnut mixture.</li>
            <li>Gently fold in the remaining egg whites.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 340°F/170°C.</li>
            <li>Pour the cake batter into the prepared pan and spread it out evenly.</li>
            <li>Bake the cake for 15 minutes and rotate the pan halfway through the cooking time.</li>
            <li>Remove the cake from the pan and let it cool completely.  Remove and discard the parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Starting 1”/2.5 cm away from the short edge of the cake, cut diagonally towards the bottom to create a beveled edge.  Trim any hard edges.</li>
            <li>Spoon half of the frosting into another bowl and stir in the chopped chestnuts.</li>
            <li>Spread the frosting and chestnuts in an even layer over the entire cake.</li>
            <li>Cover the work surface with plastic and carefully roll the cake towards the beveled edge.</li>
            <li>Cover the roll with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Carefully cut a 2”/5 cm slice from one end and stick it to the top of the log using frosting.</li>
            <li>Cover the remaining cake with frosting creating an irregular bark texture.</li>
            <li>Garnish with two whole chestnuts and a sprig of holly.</li>
        </ol>
